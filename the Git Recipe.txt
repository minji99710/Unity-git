Everytime you come to the classroom this will be your routine:

========= COMMANDS TO SET THE CREDENTIALS AND REPOSITORY========
git config --global user.name "minji99710"  (This command sets your username)
git config --global user.email "alswl99710@gmail.com"   (This command sets your email)
git remote set-url origin <repository_url_here>  (This command sets the repository that we will push to)
=========================================================

========= COMMANDS TO CHECK THAT YOUR CONFIG IS SET WELL ========
git config --get user.name  (This command will show the current global username)
git config --get user.email  (This command will show the current global email)
git config --get remote.origin.url (This command will show the url of the repository set in origin)
=========================================================


These commands will config your credentials and make sure we can push to the repository.

Then these commands for when we make changes to the folder files:

========== COMMANDS FOR ADDING NEW CHANGES AND PUSHING THEM ======
git status (This command checks if any files were added, modified or deleted)
git add . (This command adds all additions, changes or deletions in every folder showing in git status to the next push)
git commit -m "Commit message goes here, what changed?"  (This command prepares the push with a comment)
git push origin main (This command pushes the changes to the repository)
